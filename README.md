# AWS Platform Project

Production-style AWS platform built end to end with Terraform and EKS, then analysed and cost-optimised as a FinOps case study: cost allocation, rate and usage optimisation, and a quantified saving on a live stack I built and ran myself.

## Recruiter Summary

This project demonstrates practical cloud engineering experience across Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, EKS, ECR, ALB Ingress, IAM, Helm and FinOps cost-control processes.

It shows the full lifecycle of a cloud platform build: provisioning infrastructure, deploying a containerised application, exposing it publicly through an AWS Application Load Balancer, troubleshooting real deployment issues, validating the live endpoint and safely tearing everything down to avoid unnecessary spend.

## Current Status

Phase 1 (platform build) complete. Phase 2 (FinOps cost analysis) complete.

The platform was built, deployed to EKS behind an ALB, validated, then torn down. Phase 2 analysed the real cost of that stack, identified optimisation levers and quantified a saving. See docs/finops-savings-opportunity.md and docs/finops-operating-model.md.

Terraform manages the AWS infrastructure, including the VPC, subnets, route tables, NAT Gateways, EKS cluster, node group, ECR repository, IAM roles and IRSA setup.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- AWS VPC design with public, private and database subnet tiers
- NAT Gateway and route table configuration
- Amazon ECR repository for container images
- Amazon EKS cluster provisioning
- Managed EKS node groups
- Kubernetes namespace, deployment, service and ingress manifests
- AWS Load Balancer Controller installation with Helm
- IAM Roles for Service Accounts using the EKS OIDC provider
- Secure Kubernetes runtime settings
- Real troubleshooting of Kubernetes scheduling and container runtime errors
- FinOps-style tagging and teardown discipline
- Evidence-led documentation for portfolio and recruiter review

## Completed Milestones

### Week 1 - Terraform Bootstrap

Created the foundation for a production-style Terraform workflow.

### Week 2 - AWS Networking

Built a reusable VPC module with public, private and database subnet tiers.

### Week 3 - Container Registry

Created and managed an Amazon ECR repository for the application image.

### Week 4 - EKS Foundation

Provisioned an Amazon EKS cluster and managed node group using Terraform.

### Week 5 - EKS Application Behind ALB

Deployed the application into Kubernetes and exposed it publicly through an AWS Application Load Balancer.

Validation included:

```powershell
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n platform-dev
kubectl get deployment aws-platform-app -n platform-dev
kubectl get ingress -n platform-dev
curl.exe http://ALB_DNS_NAME/health
curl.exe http://ALB_DNS_NAME/
```

The health endpoint returned:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

The application endpoint returned:

```json
{
  "environment": "dev",
  "hostname": "pod-name",
  "message": "Hello from the AWS Platform Project"
}
```

## Issues Resolved

The first EKS node group used t3.micro instances, but the application pods could not schedule because the nodes hit pod capacity limits. The node group was updated to t3.small, Terraform replaced the node group, and the pods then scheduled successfully.

During deployment, the first version of the application pods also failed because the container image used a named non-root user while the Kubernetes deployment required runAsNonRoot: true.

This was fixed by adding a numeric runtime user:

```yaml
runAsUser: 1000
runAsGroup: 1000
```

## Cost Control and Teardown

After validation, the live AWS resources were safely removed to avoid unnecessary spend.

Final checks confirmed:

- Terraform state was empty
- No EKS clusters remained
- No load balancers remained
- No active NAT Gateways remained
- No Elastic IPs remained
- No EC2 worker nodes remained
- Git working tree was clean

This is documented in:

- docs/week-5-eks-alb.md
- docs/week-5-cost-control-teardown.md

## FinOps Approach

The project uses consistent tagging to support cost allocation and accountability:

- Project
- Environment
- Owner
- CostCenter
- ManagedBy

This project is designed to show not only how infrastructure is built, but also how it is validated, documented and shut down responsibly.

## FinOps Cost Analysis (Phase 2)

Applied the FinOps Framework to the platform built in Phase 1. Inform: five-tag cost allocation, Cost Explorer analysis by service, CUR export to S3. Optimize: ranked savings backlog covering NAT gateway consolidation, spot for non-prod, node rightsizing, ECR lifecycle and untagged spend. Operate: budget alert set first, a tagging and cost allocation policy, and verified teardown at zero spend. Full detail in docs/finops-savings-opportunity.md and docs/finops-operating-model.md.

## CV-Ready Summary

Built a production-style AWS platform (Terraform, EKS, ECR, Kubernetes, Helm, ALB, IRSA, secure runtime), then ran a full FinOps analysis on it: cost allocation tagging, Cost Explorer and CUR analysis, and quantified optimisation levers (NAT gateway, node rightsizing, spot vs on-demand) to evidence accountable cloud spend management across Inform, Optimize and Operate.
